## Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Greedy Best-first Search** (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path

**Convergent Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path




This project is used to find shortest path using different algorithms and visualize them in action.
